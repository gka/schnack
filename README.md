## What the schnack?

Features:

-   Tiny! It takes only ~**8 KB!!!** to embed Schnack.
-   **Open source** and **self-hosted**.
-   Ad-free and Tracking-free. Schnack will **not disturb your users**.
-   It's simpy to moderate, with a **minimal** and **slick UI** to allow/reject comments or trust/block users.
-   **[webpush protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-12) to notify the site owner** about new comments awaiting for moderation.
-   **Third party providers for authentication** like Github, Twitter, Google and Facebook. Users are not required to register a new account on your system and you don't need to manage a user management system.

### Quickstart

This is the fastest way to setup _schnack_.

**Requirements**:

-   Node.js (>= v6)
-   npm (>= v5)

Create a new folder for schnack and change into it:

```bash
mkdir schnack
cd schnack
npm init schnack -- --tag=alpha
```

Since no `schnack.json` has been found in your folder, the init script copied over the default config.

Now edit the config file according to [configuration](https://schnack.cool/#configuration) section:

```bash
vim schnack.json                 # or open with any editor of your choice
```

Finally, run `npm init schnack` again to finish installation:

```bash
npm init schnack
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Embed in your HTML page:

```html
<div class="comments-go-here"></div>
<script
    src="https://comments.example.com/embed.js"
    data-schnack-slug="post-slug"
    data-schnack-target=".comments-go-here"
></script>
```

**or** initialize _schnack_ programmatically:

```html
<div class="comments-go-here"></div>

<script src="http://comments.example.com/client.js"></script>
<script>
    new Schnack({
        target: '.comments-go-here',
        slug: 'post-slug',
        host: 'http://comments.example.com'
    });
</script>
```

You will find further information on the [schnack page](https://schnack.cool/).

### Plugins

Authentication and notification providers can be added via plugins.

```sh
npm install @schnack/plugin-auth-github  @schnack/plugin-auth-google @schnack/plugin-notify-slack
```

To enable the plugins you need to add them to the `plugins` section of your `schnack.json`:

```js
{
    // ...
    "plugins": {
        "auth-github": {
            "client_id": "xxxxx",
            "client_secret": "xxxxx"
        },
        "auth-google": {
            "client_id": "xxxxx",
            "client_secret": "xxxxx"
        },
        "notify-slack": {
            "webhook_url": "xxxxx"
        }
    }
}
```

if you want to write your own plugins you need to install them and specify their package name in the `schnack.json`. Otherwise Schnack would try to load as from `@schnack/plugin-my-plugin`.

```js
{
    // ...
    "plugins": {
        "my-plugin": {
            "pkg": "my-schnack-plugin",
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Feel free to open a PR on [schnack-plugins](https://github.com/schn4ck/schnack-plugins) with your plugin if you want to add it to the "official" repository.
