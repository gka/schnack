## What the schnack?

Features:
- Tiny! It takes only ~**8 KB!!!** to embed Schnack.
- **Open source** and **self-hosted**.
- Ad-free and Tracking-free. Schnack will **not disturb your users**.
- It's simpy to moderate, with a **minimal** and **slick UI** to allow/reject comments or trust/block users.
- **[webpush protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-12) to notify the site owner** about new comments awaiting for moderation.
- **Third party providers for authentication** like Github, Twitter, Google and Facebook. Users are not required to register a new account on your system and you don't need to manage a user management system.

### Quickstart

This is the fastest way to setup *schnack*.

**Requirements**:
- Node.js (>= v6)
- npm (>= v5)

Clone or download schnack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schn4ck/schnack
```

Go to the schnack directory:
```bash
cd schnack
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Copy and edit the config file according to [configuration](https://schnack.cool/#configuration) section:

```bash
cp config.tpl.json config.json
vim config.json                 # or open with any editor of your choice
```

Run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Embed in your HTML page:

```html
<div class="comments-go-here"></div>
<script src="https://comments.example.com/embed.js"
    data-schnack-slug="post-slug"
    data-schnack-target=".comments-go-here">
</script>
```

**or** initialize *schnack* programmatically:

```html
<div class="comments-go-here"></div>

<script src="http://comments.example.com/client.js"></script>
<script>
    new Schnack({
        target: '.comments-go-here',
        slug: 'post-slug',
        host: 'http://comments.example.com'
    });
</script>
```

You will find further information on the [schnack page](https://schnack.cool/).

### Configuration

**Notify Providers:**

* pushover
* webpush
* slack
* rss
* sendmail
* [Jira Cloud](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/)

#### Setting up Jira

The Jira notifier adds a task to the backlog of your nominated project. This allows your team to assign a workflow to the moderation / approval process.

**1: Setup the Application in Jira**

1. Log into Jira using a privileged account, then visit [Atlassian Account API Token Manager](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens)
1. Click _Create API Token_ and enter a label
1. When the [Your new API token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/files/938839638/938839639/1/1507010022324/Screen+Shot+2017-09-25+at+5.09.09+pm.png) modal is shown, click the _Copy to clipboard_ button
1. Using [your favourite Base64 Encoding tool](https://www.base64decode.org/), create the Base64 encoded string `my-email@example.com:my-copied-atlassian-token`
1. Copy the resulting string to the `notify.jira.basic_auth.base64` property

**2: Assign a board to receive notifications**

1. Collect a list of the boards available by running `npm run jira-boards`
2. Find the board you'd like to push notifications to, and note the `projectKey`
3. Add the `projectKey` to the `notify.jira.project_key`

**3: Test**

1. Send a test task to the board, by running `npm run jira-test`


**Authentication Providers:**

* Twitter
* GitHub
* Google Accounts
* Facebook
* Mastodon
* [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)

#### Setting up Cognito

**Set up a user pool**

1. Log in to your Amazon AWS Account, and find the Cognito service
1. Sign up for Cognito if you have not already
1. Click _Manage User Pools_
1. Click _Create a user pool_
1. Create a pool name (can be anything you like)
1. Click _Step Through Settings_ and follow the wizard to set up the new user pool

**Set up an authentication app**

1. From the main  screen / control panel for your new user pool, click _App Integration=> App client settings_
1. Check _Enabled Identity Providers => Select All_ (making sure _Cognito User Pool_ is also checked)
1. Enter your Sign-in URL (`http://mydomain/auth/cognito/callback`)
1. Check _OAuth 2.0 => Authorization code grant_
1. Check **at least** _Allowed OAuth Scopes => aws.cognito.signin.user.admin_ (others can be used, if required)
1. Note the _App client => ID_, and copy to the `oauth.cognito.client_id` property in the `config.json` file

**Get / create a domain prefix**

1. From the main  screen / control panel for your new user pool, click _App Integration=> Domain name_
1. If there isn't one already, create a new domain prefix
1. Note the domain prefix, and copy to the `oauth.cognito.domain_prefix` property in the `config.json` file
1. Note the region (between the `auth` and the `amazoncognito` parts of the domain, eg `eu-west-1`) and copy to the `oauth.cognito.region` property in the `config.json` file

**Get the client secret**

1. From the main  screen / control panel for your new user pool, click _General settings => App clients_
1. Find the app you'd like to integrate (or create a new app client, if needed)
1. Click the _Show Details_ button
1. Note the App client secret, and copy and copy to the `oauth.cognito.client_secret` property in the `config.json` file

#### CORS Issues

If you bump into CORS issues when attempting authentication across different ports **during development**, you may need to use a proxy tunnel to pipe requests from one port to another. Eg:

`https://comments.localhost.lcl` => `https://localhost:8080`
`https://schnack.localhost.lcl` => `https://localhost:3000`

This can be achieved using third party servers like Apache or Nginx, combined with _Proxy Pass_ to forward traffic from a neutral port (like `443`), to the server ports.

If you do this, you will also need to update `test/index.html` with the address of the proxied Schnack server.

### Included SSL Certificates

The SSL Certificates included in the `/certs` directory are for **development purposes only**. These are used to make it possible to fetch data and perform authentication over SSL, on `localhost`. **DO NOT** use them in a production environment.
